### Keywords

* ii1 - **Variability Management** - An approach to structure, implement and document software variability with repeatability.
* ii2 - **Domain Specific Language (DSL)** - Computer language specialized for a particular domain.
* ii3 - **Reflectiv middleware** - Systems that dynamically self-adapt to changing domains and environment conditions.
* ii4 - **Dynamic Variability** - Variations in context and structural and environment conditions at runtime.

### Feature Extraction

* iii1- **Informative visualizations** - The below figure demonstrates the 3 levels of abstraction in the approach used by Genie. The lowest level is composed of source code files and data files. On level two includes the different models associated with components. Level three has state diagrams and flow diagrams that result in system reconfigurations.
