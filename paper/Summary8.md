### Keywords
**ii1 Dynamically adaptive system (DAS) **

Self-reconfiguration enables a dynamically adaptive system (DAS) to satisfy requirements even as detrimental system and environmental conditions arise.

**ii2 Taxonomy**

This paper proposes a classification of potential sources of uncertainty at the requirements, design, and execution phases, and identifies existing techniques for mitigating specific types of uncertainty.

**ii3 Uncertainity**

Refers to to the unpredictable system and environmental conditions that a DAS will encounter as it executes.

**ii4 requirements engineering**

Requirements engineering (RE) refers to the process of defining, documenting and maintaining requirements and to the subfields of systems engineering and software engineering concerned with this process.

**iii2 Patterns**

The authors have provided a detailed description of the steps to keep in mind while describing the taxonomy of Uncertainity. They have started by defining the various kinds of uncertainities, provided a template for describing an uncertainty and finally providing a detailed description of the uncertainities in the requirements, design and run-time phase of the development cycle.

**iii3 Checklists**

The authors provide a checklist in the form of a table summarizing the taxonony of uncertainity in a DAS.

**iii4 Future work**

Towards the end of the paper , the authors point the need to include integrating the techniques presented along with existing tehniques for resolving combinations of uncertainty, as well as further investigations into avoidance and/or mitigation strategies for those types of uncertainty that have not been as extensively studied.

### Improvement possibilities

**iv1 Baseline results** :

This paper only provides a definition and taxonomy of the uncertainity in a DAS. This methodology has not been actually implemented on a system to obtain any kind of statistical results that could be conidered as a baseline for future studies.

**iv2 Tutorial materials** :

Since the area of DAS and self repairing system is fairly new, tutorial materials could help researchers and students in the field gain a better understanding of the concept and the available material on the subject.

**iv3 Study instruments** :

The authors could also provide a guide containing some kind of reference material about the study instuments that could be used to implement the taxonomy described in the paper.

### Connection to previous paper
This paper adds more detail to the concepts discussed in the previous papers. While paper 1 also discusses runtime requirement-monitoring , this paper describes a way to further handle the unsertainity that is a core problem of self adaptive systems.
