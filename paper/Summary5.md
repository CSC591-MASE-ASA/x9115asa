N. Bencomo et al., “Genie: Supporting the Model-Driven Development of Reflective, Component-Based Adaptive Systems,” Proc. 30th Int’l Conf. Software Eng. (ICSE 08), ACM Press, 2008, pp. 811-814

### Keywords

* ii1 - **Variability Management** - An approach to structure, implement and document software variability with repeatability.
* ii2 - **Domain Specific Language (DSL)** - Computer language specialized for a particular domain.
* ii3 - **Reflectiv middleware** - Systems that dynamically self-adapt to changing domains and environment conditions.
* ii4 - **Dynamic Variability** - Variations in context and structural and environment conditions at runtime.

### Feature Extraction

* iii1- **Informative visualizations** - The below figure demonstrates the 3 levels of abstraction in the approach used by Genie. The lowest level is composed of source code files and data files. On level two includes the different models associated with components. Level three has state diagrams and flow diagrams that result in system reconfigurations.

* iii2 - **Commentary** - 
The authors mention the two methods used to test the genie tool: The first one being a sensor network used to predict flooding of a river valley in North-West England. This case study is in the context of mobile computing environment applications which need to dynamically discover services in highly heterogeneous environments.

* iii4 - **Future Work** - 
The authors of the paper wish to make the genie tool reconfigurable at runtime. The authors also wish to enhance Genie with validation capabilities so it can return a list of conflicts that need to be resolved.

### Improvements

1. iv1 - The authors state that their tool was used to demonstrate two test cases but no quantitative data to strengthen this claim has been provided. 

2. iv2 - The authors mention requirement models in i* but the term has not been defined making it difficult to gain context. 

3. iv3 - It would be great if the authors could provide downloadable content similar to gridkit.
