## Code 9 - A simple standard genetic algorithm

#### Abstract
This paper discusses the implementation of Genetic Algorithms, findings and reasonings behind making various implementation decisions. This implementation follows the semantics of GA wherein a new generation of candidates are created by selecting, crossovering and mutating the previous generation of candidates. The specifics of these operations are discussed ahead.
