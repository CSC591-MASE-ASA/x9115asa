### Keywords
**ii1 Dynamic Decision Networks**

Dynamic Decision networks (DNs) extend Bayesian networks to provide a mechanism for making rational decisions by combining probability and utility theory over changes in variables over time.

**ii2 Bayesian network **

Bayesian network is a probabilistic model that represents a set of random variables or chance nodes and their conditional dependencies.

**ii3 Decision Node **

A decision node D<sub>t</sub> represents the decision taken when specifying the topology to be used in time slice t.

**ii4 Evidence Node **

The evidence node E<sub>t</sub> represents the information observed by monitorables.
