DeLoach, Scott A., and Matthew Miller. "A goal model for adaptive complex systems." International Journal of Computational Intelligence: Theory and Practice 5.2 (2010): 83-92.

#### Keywords

1. ii1 - **Goal classes** - goals that are specified by the system designer to model the goal interactions within the organization.
2. ii2 - **Goal instances**  -The runtime instantiation of a goal class with specific parameters.
3. ii3 - **Goal Specification tree** - A GMoDS goal specification tree (GSpec) specifies how the goal classes are related to one another.
4. ii4 - **Goal Triggers** - A set of relations within the tree structure to specify how runtime goals may interact.

#### Feature Extraction

* iii1 - **Future Work** - The authors propose to extend the presented work by taking into account soft goals, goal preferences and goal metrics into their GMoDS goal model.


* iii2 - **Informative Visualisations** - The authors have illustrated their concepts of goal specification, instantiation and realization through visualizations like graphs and trees. These media are powerful instructors because relationships between entities like depends, precredes and consists of, are best explained visually.


* iii3 - **Related Work** - The authors have identified several related studies and frameworks
